# Name Generator

This is a name generator I built to help come up with working titles for my personal projects. You can access it at [ng.kaisare.in](https://ng.kaisare.in).

It's probably the simplest React app one could write, save the standard counter demo. An earlier version combined a random adjective with a random animal (and you can find the source files for both under `src/assets`); the current version strives to a mild esotericity, concatenating a specified number of randomly generated syllables.
